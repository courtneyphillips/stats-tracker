# Stats Tracker

Stats Tracker is a basic application written in Ember.js and JavaScript to track the shots taken by multiple basketball players on multiple different teams. Included is the ability to dynamically caluculate shot percentages.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/courtneyphillips/stats-tracker.git`
* navigate into the new directory in the terminal
*  run `npm install`
* run `bower install`

## Running / Development

* Run `ember server` to launch the application.
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Developmental Roadmap

Stats Tracker is by no means complete. In the future, I'd like to add the capability to track fouls, three-point shots, etcetera, while still dynamically calculating corresponding percentages. Additionally, I'd like to be able to calculate shot percenttages, etc. for  a team as a whole, given multiple players' stats have been tracked.
